# AI-Assisted Development Framework

A comprehensive framework for leveraging AI assistants throughout the software development lifecycle, from concept to deployment.

## Overview

This framework provides structured templates and workflows to effectively use AI models like Claude, ChatGPT, and Augment Code to accelerate software development while maintaining quality. By following these templates, developers can:

- Maintain consistency across AI interactions
- Leverage each AI model's specific strengths
- Create a documented development process
- Reduce development time and errors
- Implement best practices like TDD and SOLID principles

The framework is designed to be model-agnostic, with recommendations for specific AI assistants based on their strengths, while providing alternatives when premium models aren't available.

## Requirements

- Access to AI assistants (free or paid tiers)
- Basic understanding of software development principles
- Markdown-compatible environment for template usage
