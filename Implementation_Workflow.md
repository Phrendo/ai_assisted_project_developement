# AI-Assisted Development Workflow

## 1. Project Definition Phase
1. Complete the Project Inception template with Claude Sonnet
2. Refine project goals and requirements based on AI feedback
3. Research similar projects and best practices with AI assistance

## 2. Architecture Phase
1. Use the System Architecture template with Claude Sonnet
2. Generate and refine Mermaid diagrams for system components
3. Validate technology choices with Augment Code

## 3. Planning Phase
1. Define MVP using the MVP Definition template with Claude Sonnet
2. Create development plan using Development Planning template
3. Break down into epics and user stories

## 4. Task Implementation Cycle
For each feature or component:

1. Create detailed tasks using Task Breakdown template with Augment Code
2. Generate test cases first (TDD approach) with Claude Opus
3. Implement code with Augment Code using Code Implementation template
4. Review code with Augment Code using Code Review template
5. Document the component with Claude Opus

## 5. Integration Phase
1. Plan integration using Iteration Planning template
2. Implement integration tests with Augment Code
3. Address integration issues with Augment Code
4. Document integration points with Claude Opus

## 6. Refinement Phase
1. Review entire project with Claude Sonnet
2. Identify optimization opportunities with Augment Code
3. Refine documentation with Claude Opus
4. Plan next iteration with Claude Sonnet

## Key Principles
1. **Single Responsibility**: Each AI prompt should focus on one specific task
2. **Iterative Development**: Multiple small improvements over big changes
3. **Test-First**: Generate tests before implementation
4. **Documentation as Code**: Document alongside development
5. **Continuous Review**: Regular AI-assisted code reviews
